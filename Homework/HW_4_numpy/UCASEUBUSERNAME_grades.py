	'''
	filename is a text string containing the name and extension of a file containing student scores.  For example, `grades_example.csv`.  See the example file for details about the file structure.

	numExams is an integer.  It tells us how many exams are in the gradebook.  Exams will always be in the last column(s).

	hwWeight is a float in [0,1].  This value tells us the percentage of the overall grade that is composed of the student's average homework percentage.  The remaining percentage will be applied to the average exam percentage.  For example, if hwWeight = 0.3, then the exams are weighted by 0.7 (0.3 + 0.7 = 1.0).
